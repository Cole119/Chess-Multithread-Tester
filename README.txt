Typing 'make' should compile the tool. If not, type 'g++ -o chess_runner chess_runner.cpp'.

To run the tool, type 'chess_runner <prog> [args]', where <prog> is the program you wish to test and
[args] are a list of arguments to pass to <prog> (optional).

chess.so and run.sh are required for the tool to work. Also, you may have to give run.sh execute permissions.
